# Learning repository

This repository will contain implementation of classic algorithms and mock interview questions.

## Based on the following materials:
* https://class.coursera.org/algo2-004
* https://class.coursera.org/algo-008
* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8jOj7diA0&list=PL9D558D49CA734A02
* "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

## Data structures
* [DONE] Graphs
* [DONE] Linked lists (reverse linked list)
* [DONE] Heap
* Set
* Binary Trees
* Tries
* Stacks
* Queues
* Priority Queue
* Vectors / ArrayLists
* Hash Tables
* Map (Binary tree)
* Circular buffer
* Doubly Linked List

## Algorithms
* [DONE] Breadth first search
* [DONE] Depth first search
* Binary search
* Dijkstra Shortest Path
* [DONE] Merge sort
* [DONE] Quick sort
* [DONE] Random Select
* [DONE] Determenistic Select
* [DONE] Min cut search in graphs
* remove duplicates from a list of strings which is larger than the available memory (i.e. with reloads from disk)
* count the number of disjoint objects in a bitmap
* implement a program which plays tic-tac-toe
* Tree insert / find etc.

## Concepts

* finite automata
* Bit manipulation
* Singleton Design Pattern
* Factory design pattern
* Memory (Stack vs Heap)
* Recursion
* Big-O Time
