# Learning repository

This repository will contain implementation of classic algorithms and mock interview questions.

## Based on the following materials:
* https://class.coursera.org/algo2-004/auth
* "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

## Data structures
* [DONE] Graphs
* [DONE] Linked lists (reverse linked list)
* [DONE] Heap
* [DONE] Binary Trees
* Doubly Linked List
* Set
* Tries
* Stacks
* Queues
* Priority Queue
* Vectors / ArrayLists
* Hash Tables
* Map (Binary tree)
* Circular buffer
* Bunch
* Pool

## Algorithms
* [DONE] Breadth first search
* [DONE] Depth first search
* [DONE] Dijkstra Shortest Path
* [DONE] Merge sort
* [DONE] Quick sort
* [DONE] Random Select
* [DONE] Determenistic Select
* [DONE] Min cut search in graphs
* [DONE] Find in an array a subarray, which has the max sum of all elements.
* [DONE] implement a program which plays tic-tac-toe
* [DONE] Tree insert / find etc.
* Find cycle in the linked list (returning true or false)
* Find cycle in the linked list (returning link to the first element in the cycle)
* Checking if the code with different brackets is valid (recursive and with stack)
* Water spillage in the labyrinth
* Binary search
* remove duplicates from a list of strings which is larger than the available memory (i.e. with reloads from disk)
* count the number of disjoint objects in a bitmap
* tree balancing
* Find biggest island in O(n*m) with recursion

## Concepts
* invariants
* finite automata
* Bit manipulation
* Singleton Design Pattern
* Factory design pattern
* Memory (Stack vs Heap)
* Recursion
* Big-O Time
* Balancer
* Deadlock
